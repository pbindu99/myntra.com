    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>Cred Buddha operates under the brand name “Cred Buddha” (hereinafter referred to as the "Company" or “We” or “Us” or “Our”) and collects information from the user accounts created by individuals on the Cred Buddha platform. It also collects data from other digital sources of information relating to such individuals (each a “User”) as set out herein. Cred Buddha uses the information to undertake, and accounts each Users’ credit worthiness which in turn may enable such Users to make applications for one or more credit facilities (each an “Application for Credit”) to credit providing financial institutions affiliated with Cred Buddha (referred as “Cred Buddha Partner”). Each of the credit worthiness assessment and the application for a credit facility form part of services offered by Cred Buddha to Users and Cred Buddha Partners (individually and collectively the “Services”).</p>
    <p>The Company collects information from users at the time of account creation as well as on an ongoing basis from their emails, text messages, mobile phone address book, social media profiles and such other sources as authorized by the users and mingles it to create unique profiles for individuals that it uses in conjunction with proprietary algorithms to determine whether or not a particular individual should be offered the Service. We also provide risk evaluation and management services to the Cred Buddha Partners.</p>
    <p>The Service also relies on other factors such as the amount/limit of credit facility (“Advance”) sought and other parameters/requirements set out by Cred Buddha Partners including their credit eligibility parameters. Kindly note that all individuals whose information is collected by the Company will not be offered the Credit Facility of the Service because the Service provides a dynamic evaluation of risk. Hence, the Company or the Cred Buddha Partner independently may evaluate an individual’s application and may allow him/her to submit an Application for Credit for a sum up to a specified credit limit, unique to that individual based on his credit analysis, to a Cred Buddha Partner but disallow submission of Application for Credit to another Cred Buddha Partner. Each offer of Service made by the Company is based on the Company’s proprietary and discretionary decision-making methodologies and also relies on the credit risk requirements specified by a Cred Buddha Partner.</p>
